# CWLWERX - A tidy collection of CWL Workflows

## Info

This repository is a growing collection of workflows written in CWL, various command-line tools, and Dockerfiles for use specifically on Arvados. The purpose of this collection is to dually highlight one style of writing CWL, but also to showcase many of the various tasks CWL can help bioinformaticians to accomplish. In the future, a README will be included in every workflow directory. 

## Extras

This repository also will include helpful scripts and command-line tools to complete filtering tasks. These tools are largely experimental and should be used with caution.
